# Unit-6-Pyviz-Homework

This is an analysis of San Francisco rental prices and neighborhoods. I tried my best, and I'm just proud of the fact that I created tabs and multiple plots. Some plots didn't come out as planned, but I'll continue to troubleshoot them going further. I have two main tabs, the first describing rental prices and square footage, the second neighborhoods.
